#facebook-ddp

#####Summary

Modification of meteor's [facebook](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/facebook) package so that mobile DDP clients can log in with OAuth.

This version is based on [jasper-lu](https://github.com/jasper-lu)'s work but with slight modifications to allow the request of the logged user's information.

#####Observations

This package works with [accounts-facebook-ddp](https://github.com/FranciscoVictor/accounts-facebook-ddp), so please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/FranciscoVictor/accounts-facebook-ddp/blob/master/README.md#instructions) to use it.
